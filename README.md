# CoffeeMachine
Coffee Machine project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself.
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we
should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine
simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs 
out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and 
latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Thoughts
Project evolves through six stages, starting with just printing out the steps of making a coffee, through
adding in water, milk, beans fields, finally ending with a full-fledged coffee machine that can be re-filled
and money taken out of. Last stage involves designing a state machine using enums. Overall, a good project
to work through.
